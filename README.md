# dbscan outlier detection
*Explore how to implement DBSCAN.*

_DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. It finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them. 
It is an excellent technique to find clusters and as well as outliers in the data.
We will use it to find the outliers in our dataset._
